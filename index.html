However, it is difficult to compare prices every day in all stores in the area, which is why we have created Dealsan - the first comparison website in Germany that allows you to track prices of food and everyday products sold both traditionally and online, "says Adam Rzepkowski, managing director at dealsan. Check more info here - <a href="https://about.me/dealsanpreisvergleich">https://about.me/dealsanpreisvergleich</a>
</div><div>
</div><div>The platform focuses exclusively on everyday products bought for the home - i.e. food, dietary supplements, household chemicals, alcohol and cosmetics - which are currently on sale. It stands out from other comparison websites in that it allows you to track price promotions offered by both online and stationary stores in one place. In addition, it allows you to compare promotions between retail chains, because - as it turns out - not every promotion is a guarantee of the best price.
</div><div>
</div><div>"The differences in promotional prices for the same products in different stores sometimes reach up to 100%. We buy a promotional product for euro 14, and in the store next to it, the same product from the promotional magazine costs euro &nbsp;7-8. Our comparison of offers from various traditional and online stores allows the consumer to check whether given promotions defend themselves against the competition. Our user gets clear information where the selected product is at the lowest price at a given time, "explains Rzepkowski.
</div><div>
</div><div>The site is currently comparing 400,000 products from almost 600 online stores and 50 retail chains, including brands such as Biedronka, Lidl, Auchan Direct or the online Tesco store. "For comparison, there are up to 10,000 on the shelves in Biedronka or Lidl. products, and in the hypermarket - up to 100,000 products. It shows how huge a database we have, ”says Paweł Dziennik, director of IT dealsan department.
</div><div>
</div><div>Every week, the dealsan.pl team analyzes dozens of promotional brochures from retail chains and publishes information on prices of around 10,000 products in the promotion weekly. For products sold by stationary stores, it indicates to the user the location nearest to him where he will make the most advantageous purchases.
</div><div>
</div><div>"We have also launched a service that allows you to create a shopping list so that the user has in one place your favorite products and is kept informed via e-mail about whether any of them is currently in the promotion and where to buy the cheapest".</div><div>
</div><div>The platform was created 5 years ago and has been developing dynamically since then. Almost 5 million Germans have benefited from it since its inception. Last year, she was awarded the Expert Laurel for a modern service meeting the needs of consumers.
</div><div>
</div><div>The creators of the website also cooperate with producers and retail chains, offering them the analytical panel dealsan Analytics. The database contains almost half a million promotional prices that allow for accurate analysis of 200 thousand. products - in what commercial network, at what price and when they appeared on the promotion and how are their prices on the Internet. An important element of the analysis are presented in the panel of behavior of consumers visiting the portal, i.e. product popularity rankings for products, brands and retail chains, or aggregated data presenting the customer's shopping paths before the final selection of a product or store.
</div><div>
</div><div>"This is an interesting solution for traders and producers from the FMCG industry who are interested in tracking customers' shopping behavior and preferences to plan sales increasing activities on their basis," says Adam Rzepkowski.
</div><div>
</div><div>The dynamic development of the website and the utility of the service appreciated by consumers have been noticed by large international companies. Currently, the creators of dealsan.de are conducting negotiations with potential investors regarding cooperation on the planned expansion into the markets of Great Britain, France and Germany.</div></h3>
