                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div>Recycling aims to reduce waste and the consumption of natural resources. In order not to dispose of waste permanently, it must be segregated. This custom generates a lot of savings in your home budget. Current regulations regarding the removal of household garbage guarantee that fees for segregated waste are lower. In order to segregate garbage at home, you must obtain additional containers to collect separately paper, plastic and metal materials, colored and white glass. Large external containers for segregated waste can in most cases be bought or leased from a waste collection company. At many housing estates in Poland there are marked, often colored containers, to which you can throw segregated rubbish free of charge.
</div><div>
</div><div>The following are suitable for recycling: paper, glass, metals, plastics (plastic), clothes, electrical equipment. They are often marked with an appropriate symbol<br><br>Good ways to segregate rubbish:
</div><div>
</div><div>· Waste paper - we can throw it into a waste paper container or return it to a collection point. 1 ton of waste paper equals 17 saved trees;
</div><div>
</div><div>· Plastic - bottle caps can be collected and given to a noble purpose, in most schools or kindergartens there are special containers for caps. After crushing the plastic bottles, throw them into labeled containers. 35 recycled PET bottles can be used to sew 1 fleece blouse;
</div><div>
</div><div>· Unnecessary clothing - we place it in a labeled container, it will be used by those in need or for the production of cleaning cloths. For small clothes after children, we can give to friends who have younger offspring. As a thank you they can repay the same, which means that both we and our friends can save on new clothes;
</div><div>
</div><div>· Glass - do not mix white and colored glass. Before we throw them into the appropriate container, remove the caps and labels, we do not need to wash the glass containers. Do not throw window glass, ceramics, cathode ray tubes or bulbs into containers. Annually, over 5 billion jars accumulate in landfills. One jar of recovery saves energy used for 25 minutes of computer work or 5 hours of light bulb lighting. In addition, we can give jars or bottles, e.g. to grandma, who will prepare jam or tincture in them - she will not have to buy new containers, and we will take preserves;
</div><div>
</div><div>· Used batteries - we throw them into containers standing in shops, offices, schools. A small battery can contaminate 1 m3 of soil and poison 400 liters of water;
</div><div>
</div><div>· Waste electrical and electronic equipment - it is collected by stores when we buy the same type of equipment, and municipal companies with whom we have a contract for waste collection. Sometimes it happens that by returning used equipment to the store, we get a discount for the purchase of a new device;
</div><div>
</div><div>· Out-of-date medicines - we give them to pharmacies where special containers are usually found. We will then be sure that the drugs will go to the incineration plant and will not hurt anyone.<br><br>Check here - <a href="https://www.junkbobby.com/">Junk Removal service</a></div></h3>
